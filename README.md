# digital-wallet-and-agent-overviews
The objective of this SIG is to develop and maintain the Digital Wallet Overview and a similar overview for digital identity agents/SDKs. These overviews should provide transparency of the characteristics of wallets and agents in order to allow for comparison and effective decision making on which wallet is applicable for your use case.
